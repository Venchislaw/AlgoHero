```
So far we know the difference between linked data structures and contiguous data structures.
We also covered containers: data structures that store data without taking datatype into account.

Dictionaries permit access to data items by content.
Main operations:
- **Search(D, k)**
- **Insert(D,x)**
- **Delete(D, x)**

Search - search by given search key *k*. Returns a pointer to the element in dictionary D mapped to the key *k*, if one exists.
Insert - Inserts *data item* (pair I guess) to dictionary
Delete - Removes data item from dictionary D by pointer given.

Some dictionary ds also support:
- **Min(D)/Max(D)**
- **Predecessor(D,x)/Successor(D,x)**
Min/Max - retrieves the item with the smallest (or biggest) key value.
Predecessor/Successor - retrieves the item whose key is immediately before (or after) item x in sorted order. 

With these we can "sort" our dictionary.

## Implementations of Dictionaries.
There are many implementations of dictionaries out there (hashtables, bsts), but let's talk about **array-based dictionaries** and **list-based dictionaries**

*Problem: What are the asymptotic worst-case running times for all seven fundamental dictionary operations (search, insert, delete, successor, predecessor, minimum, and maximum) when the data structure is implemented as:*
- An unsorted array.
- A sorted array.

My table:

| Operation:  | Unsorted Arr | Sorted Arr |
| ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| search      | $O(n)$       | $O(log_n)$ |
| insert      | $O(1)$       | $O(n)$     |
| delete      | $O(n)$       | $O(n)$     |
| successor   | $O(n)$       | $O(1)$     |
| predecessor | $O(n)$       | $O(1)$     |
| minimum     | $O(n)$       | $O(1)$     |
| maximum     | $O(n)$       | $O(1)$     |
Right table:

Bruh. I forgot that delete method takes pointer as input (so we don't need to search for it)
Funny note:
Sorted and unsorted arrays have "inverse" complexities.

*Problem: What are the asymptotic worst-case running times for each of the seven fundamental dictionary operations when the data structure is implemented as*

- A singly linked unsorted list
- A doubly linked unsorted list
- A singly linked sorted list
-  A doubly linked unsorted list

| Operation:  | SL Unsorted | SL Sorted | DL Unsorted | DL Sorted |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | --------- |
| search      | $O(n)$      | $O(n)$    | $O(n)$      | $O(n)$    |
| insert      | $O(1)$      | $O(n)$    | $O(1)$      | $O(n)$    |
| delete      | $O(1)$      | $O(n)$    | $O(1)$      | $O(1)$    |
| successor   | $O(n)$      | $O(1)$    | $O(n)$      | $O(1)$    |
| predecessor | $O(n)$      | $O(n)$    | $O(n)$      | $O(1)$    |
| minimum     | $O(n)$      | $O(1)$    | $O(n)$      | $O(1)$    |
| maximum     | $O(n)$      | $O(n)$    | $O(n)$      | $O(n)$    |

I was confused, but it appeared that Steven used some tricks denoted with *

delete operation in singly linked list uses predecessor node.
![[Pasted image 20240810132902.png]]
In singly linked list we can't do it in constant time, as we don't have predecessor pointer.
O(1) min/max operation is achieved through maintenance of tail pointer.
In this way our deletion will take O(n) maintaining this pointer.

Alright! That's it about Algorithms for today! (Page 96)
