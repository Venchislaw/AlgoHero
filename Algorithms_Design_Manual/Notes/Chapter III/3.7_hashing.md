```
Previous note gently introduces the idea of priority queues.
Priority queue is a data structure with 3 key operations:
1) Insert
2) Min/Max
3) DeleteMin/DeleteMax
The name links to the priority of the Min/Max values, as we can not retrieve or delete an arbitary value. 
```

Hash tables, which are *a very practical way to maintain a dictionary*(see [[3.3_dictionaries]]) use hash function to map a key to a big integer value.
There are many hash functions available.
For example to map strings to integers we can come up with the following function:

$$H(S) = \alpha^{[S]} + \sum_{i=0}^{|S|-1}\alpha^{|S|-(i+1)}\times char(s_i)$$

Where $\alpha$ is the size of the alphabet on which our S is written.
$char()$ returns integer value for an input char (output ranges from 0 to $\alpha - 1$). 

Is it a good hash function? Idk lol.

(Nice phrase from Grokking Algorithms comes up to my mind: 
"What is a good hash function? That’s something you’ll never have to worry about—old men (and women) with big beards sit in dark rooms and worry about that").

In order to fit the number of slots in hash table.
We need to take $mod$ of it, by taking the remainder of $H(S)/m$.
This scaling can be compared to a wheel of fortune (or whatever its name is) in casinos. Despite our ball rolls the distance of wheel, it falls into one of the slots.
