recap zone:
```
Previous note gently introduces the idea of priority queues.
Priority queue is a data structure with 3 key operations:
1) Insert
2) Min/Max
3) DeleteMin/DeleteMax
The name links to the priority of the Min/Max values, as we can not retrieve or delete an arbitary value. 
```

Hash tables, which are *a very practical way to maintain a dictionary*(see [[3.3_dictionaries]]) use hash function to map a key to a big integer value.
There are many hash functions available.
For example to map strings to integers we can come up with the following function:

$$H(S) = \alpha^{[S]} + \sum_{i=0}^{|S|-1}\alpha^{|S|-(i+1)}\times char(s_i)$$

Where $\alpha$ is the size of the alphabet on which our S is written.
$char()$ returns integer value for an input char (output ranges from 0 to $\alpha - 1$). 

Is it a good hash function? Idk lol.

(Nice phrase from Grokking Algorithms comes up to my mind: 
"What is a good hash function? That’s something you’ll never have to worry about—old men (and women) with big beards sit in dark rooms and worry about that").

In order to fit the number of slots in hash table.
We need to take $mod$ of it, by taking the remainder of $H(S)/m$.
This scaling can be compared to a wheel of fortune (or whatever its name is) in casinos. Despite our ball rolls the distance of wheel, it falls into one of the slots.

## 3.7.1 Collisions Resolution

No matter how good hash function is, we had better be prepared for *collisions*. Collisions happen when mapping the same integer value to two different keys. There are some ways for maintaining a hash table.

### Chaining
Representation of hash table with chaining is an **Array of Linked Lists**.
Those inner lists are also called *buckets*. Operations are a bit slower, but this collision resolution method is very intuitive.

This method uses additional memory for storing pointers.
So, there's another collisions resolution technique known as...

### Open addressing

Open addressing represents hash table as an array filled with *nulls* by default. When inserting a value, we check whether the current slot is free or not. If it's already occupied, we insert the value into the next empty slot (in sequential probing).
Element search now involves going to the mapped position and comparing the value in it to our search target. In case it's not equal, we continue "sliding" along the following cells, comparing their values to the desired one.

Deletion is a bit worse, because deletion of an item can break our chain, so we need to reposition our chain after each deletion.

As I know Open addressing is used in Python 
```python
dict()  # uses open addressing with linear/quadratic probing
```

## 3.7.2 Duplicate Detection.
Hash tables can be use for duplicate detection...
That's it...
I'm not gonna note examples.


## 3.7.4 Canonicalization.

We also can use hash tables for many diverse and unique tasks.
Here's a python code for finding all words from the file consisting passed characters.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# canonicalization code for finding all words containing passed letters
hashmap = defaultdict(list)

with open("words.txt") as f:
    for word in f.readlines():
        hashmap["".join(sorted(word.lower().rstrip("\n")))].append(word.lower().rstrip("\n"))
    

def find_all_words_containing_chars(charslist: list):
    charslist = [char.lower() for char in charslist]
    return hashmap["".join(sorted(charslist))]


# ['akel', 'alek', 'elka', 'kale', 'kela', 'lake', 'leak']
print(find_all_words_containing_chars(["A", "e", "k", "l"]))

```
I know this shit is scarier than nuclear war, but whatever  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Canonicalization - reduction complicated objects to a standard form.

That's all folks!
I didn't make notes for some of the chapters, because they were either too short or too weird (they were partially related to the subject of conversation).
