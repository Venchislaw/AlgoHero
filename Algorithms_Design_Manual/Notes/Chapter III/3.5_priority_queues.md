recap zone:
```
In previous note we discussed Binary Search Tree, which is one of the most useful and efficient Data Structure. Trees have particular rules of data storage, so they support relatively efficient search and insertion.
BST is Pointer-based datastructure, where each node has two pointers pointing to its children (also node may have third pointer pointing to its parent node).

**Primary Operations:**
- **Insert(x)**
- **Min()/Max()**
- **DeleteMin()/DeleteMax()**

**Basic Priority Queue**
Time complexity

| XXXX                | Unsorted Arr | Sorted Arr | Balanced BT |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| Insert              | $O(1)$       | $O(n)$     | $O(log_n)$  |
| Min/Max             | $O(1)$       | $O(1)$     | $O(1)$      |
| DeleteMin/DeleteMax | $O(n)$       | $O(1)$     | $O(log_n)$  |
Note. Delete in a sorted array takes $O(1)$ because we don't need to move elements around in case of storing the sorted array in reverse order. If the first element is the maximum, then the nth element is the minimum.
We just need to decrement n by 1 (in case of DeleteMin).
Now let's discuss why we have $O(1)$ time complexity for min/max in all data structures. The trick is fairly simple: We just store min/max in a variable and update it on insert/delete operation. On insertion it takes $O(1)$ as we just need to compare the new value to our stored one. However what about deleting? It takes $O(n)$ time to find a new min/max in an **unsorted array** and $O(log_n)$ to find it in a Balanced Binary Tree. We can include these operations in the Delete operation.

Unfortunately, that's it. This seems like a gentle introduction to Priority Queues, but I expected more.

Anyway, See Ya!
