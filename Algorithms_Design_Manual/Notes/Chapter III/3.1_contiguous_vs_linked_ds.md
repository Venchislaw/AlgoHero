Previous chapters introduced some basic concepts of algorithm design and different notations used in Algorithms design.

We can separate our Data Structures on 2 categories:
**contiguous or linked** data structures.

### Contiguous Data Structures
Array based structures which are represented with *contiguous chunk of memory*
### Linked Data Structures
Data Structures that store data in distinct parts of memory, bounding them together by *pointers*

## 3.1.1 Arrays

Arrays are fixed-size data structures allocated in memory contiguously.
That is to say, given memory address of first (zeroth) element in array,
We can get $i_{th}$ element in $O(1)$. 
#### Advantages:
- Constant-time access by index.
- Space efficiency - no need to store *pointers*
- Memory Locality - high-speed cache memory used
#### Disadvantages:
- We can not adjust their size
There is a solution to this problem known as **Dynamic Arrays**
Whenever we run out of space we just *double array size*
This process happens in the following order:
1) Allocate new $2m$ array
2) Copy contents of the old array
3) Free up the space used by the old array

All insertions are fast except rare insertions that double our array.
Expending takes $O(n)$

## 3.1.2 Pointers and Linked Data Structures
*pointers* - connections that hold pieces of Linked Data Structures together. They Represent address in memory.

Linked lists support three basic operations:
- Search
- Insert
- Delete

#### Search
There are 2 ways to implement search operation:
- recursively
- iteratively

Iterative approach:

```python
def search_list(root, value):
	while root:
		if root.val == value:
			return root  # root object pointer
		root = root.next
	return None
```

Recursive approach:

```python
def search_list(root, value):
	if not root:
		return None
	if root.val == value:
		return root
	else:
		return search_list(root.next, value)
```

Where ListNode is defined as:
```python
class ListNode:
	def __init__(self, val, next=None):
		self.val = val
		self.next = next
```

(tbh, I didn't run this code, so mayb it doesn't work idk)

#### Insert

Suppose our list is unsorted, so we can insert it wherever we want.
It's a smart move to insert it to the beginning as we don't need to iterate through all list.

```python
def insert(self, val):
	if not self.root:
		self.root = ListNode(val)
	else:
		tmp = self.root
		self.root = ListNode(val)
		self.root.next = tmp
```
Again, I didn't test it...

**See Ya Tomorrow!**
I came up with idea of .md notes too late...
