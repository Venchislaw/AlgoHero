**Container** - abstract data type that permits storage and retrieval of data items independent of content.

## Stacks
Last-in, First-out order (**LIFO**). Implementation of stacks is simple while stacks are very efficient.
Two Main operations:
- **Push**
- **Pop**
Push: lays item x on the top of the stack
Pop: returns and removes the top item from the stack

**Real life example:**
Stack of plates. You take the plate from the very top of this stack (Pop), and insert plate on the top of the stack (Push). It also satisfies LIFO order.

## Queues
They have a different order property: First-in, First-out (**FIFO**)
```
That's more fair btw)
```
Operations:
- **Enqueue**
- **Dequeue**

Enqueue: Insert item at the back of the queue
Dequeue: Return and remove front item from queue

Btw. It's harder to implement queues, but they are still useful

**Real life example:**
WoW queue


Btw. It's harder to implement queues, but they are useful still

That's it. It's a short note tbh (because this part is pretty short)
