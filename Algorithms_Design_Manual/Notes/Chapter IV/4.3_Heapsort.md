Selection sort is easy-to-code sorting algorithm. It partitions our array, takes minimum value from an unsorted part, inserts it into the sorted part and removes this minimum value from an unsorted part.
Pseudocode:

```pseudocode
selection_sort(A):
	for i in range(n):
		sort[i] = min(A)
		A.remove(min(A))
	return sort
```
This algorithm uses an array, and it takes $O(n^2)$ time complexity.
However we can dramatically speed up our algorithm using different data structure...
### **HEAP SORT!!!**
We can use Heap (priority queues) as a data structure for this purpose. It takes $O(1)$ to find $min$ in $MinHeap$ and $O(log_n)$ to delete min from the heap.
Now our time is $O(nlog_n)$ instead of $O(n^2)$.
It may sound a bit too dramatic, but suppose $n=100,000,000$

$$SelectionSort - 1×10¹⁶ operations$$
$$HeapSort - 800,000,000$$
$800,000,000$ is DOHUYA (a lot), but $10^{16}$ is ULTRA DOHUYA($10,000,000,000,000,000$)
Think Bigger.
### 4.3.1 Heaps
Heaps are a tree-like data structure, where each node dominates its children, having smaller value (in MinHeap), or bigger value (in MaxHeap)

Even though I called it a tree-like data structure it's not. I mean, we think of it as a tree, but we implement it with implicit array representation.

We store the root of the tree in the first position, and its left and right children in the second and third positions, respectively.
It's easy to access items in this representation:
left child of item in $i$ is stored in $2i$ and right child in $2i + 1$.
Node's parent is stored at index $i // 2$, where $i$ - index of the node.
Hmm... Does it mean we can store trees in arrays without pointers? Not quite... In case of a *sparse tree* with a lot of gaps we have to store them in our array representation. That is to say, to efficiently use this array representation we need to have a *dense tree* with no gaps (except right values in the last layer).
However heaps are dense trees and do not allow gaps.
### 4.3.2 Constructing Heaps
Okay, I guess I'll just provide the code here.

```python
class MinHeap:
    def __init__(self):
        self.heap = [0]
        
    def add(self, value):
        self.heap.append(value)
        i = len(self.heap) - 1
        
        while self.heap[i//2] > self.heap[i]:
            self.heap[i // 2], self.heap[i] = self.heap[i], self.heap[i // 2]
            i = i // 2
        
    def print(self):
	    print(self.heap[1:])


heap = MinHeap()
heap.add(1)
heap.add(4)
heap.add(3)
heap.add(2)

heap.print()
```
